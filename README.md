# The LLVM Compiler Infrastructure

This directory and its subdirectories contain source code for LLVM,
a toolkit for the construction of highly optimized compilers,
optimizers, and runtime environments.

## Getting Started with the LLVM System

Taken from https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html.

### Overview

Welcome to the LLVM project!

The LLVM project has multiple components. The core of the project is
itself called "LLVM". This contains all of the tools, libraries, and header
files needed to process intermediate representations and converts it into
object files.  Tools include an assembler, disassembler, bitcode analyzer, and
bitcode optimizer.  It also contains basic regression tests.

C-like languages use the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) front end.  This
component compiles C, C++, Objective C, and Objective C++ code into LLVM bitcode
-- and from there into object files, using LLVM.

Other components include:
the [libc++ C++ standard library](https://libcxx.llvm.org),
the [LLD linker](https://lld.llvm.org), and more.

### Getting the Source Code and Building LLVM

The LLVM Getting Started documentation may be out of date.  The [Clang
Getting Started](http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html) page might have more
accurate information.

This is an example workflow and configuration to get and build the LLVM source:

1. Checkout LLVM (including related subprojects like Clang):

     * ``git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git``

     * Or, on windows, ``git clone --config core.autocrlf=false
    https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git``

2. Configure and build LLVM and Clang:

     * ``cd llvm-project``

     * ``mkdir build``

     * ``cd build``

     * ``cmake -G <generator> [options] ../llvm``

        Some common generators are:

        * ``Ninja`` --- for generating [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)
          build files. Most llvm developers use Ninja.
        * ``Unix Makefiles`` --- for generating make-compatible parallel makefiles.
        * ``Visual Studio`` --- for generating Visual Studio projects and
          solutions.
        * ``Xcode`` --- for generating Xcode projects.

        Some Common options:

        * ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS='...'`` --- semicolon-separated list of the LLVM
          subprojects you'd like to additionally build. Can include any of: clang,
          clang-tools-extra, libcxx, libcxxabi, libunwind, lldb, compiler-rt, lld,
          polly, or debuginfo-tests.

          For example, to build LLVM, Clang, libcxx, and libcxxabi, use
          ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;libcxx;libcxxabi"``.

        * ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=directory`` --- Specify for *directory* the full
          pathname of where you want the LLVM tools and libraries to be installed
          (default ``/usr/local``).

        * ``-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=type`` --- Valid options for *type* are Debug,
          Release, RelWithDebInfo, and MinSizeRel. Default is Debug.

        * ``-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=On`` --- Compile with assertion checks enabled
          (default is Yes for Debug builds, No for all other build types).

      * Run your build tool of choice!

        * The default target (i.e. ``ninja`` or ``make``) will build all of LLVM.

        * The ``check-all`` target (i.e. ``ninja check-all``) will run the
          regression tests to ensure everything is in working order.

        * CMake will generate build targets for each tool and library, and most
          LLVM sub-projects generate their own ``check-<project>`` target.

        * Running a serial build will be *slow*.  To improve speed, try running a
          parallel build. That's done by default in Ninja; for ``make``, use
          ``make -j NNN`` (NNN is the number of parallel jobs, use e.g. number of
          CPUs you have.)

      * For more information see [CMake](https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html)

## XYB Port

I made the following changes based on the latest LLVM master:
- [Fix relative path in header-filter of clang-tidy.](https://github.com/xieyubo/llvm-project/commit/814910e71adf2e6e28ef6222c1b38fc916d6ba44)
- [Add option "--driver-mode" to config driver mode used by clang-tidy.](https://github.com/xieyubo/llvm-project/commit/a7533c8c292c8e8c311310e5254735dbc1ae469e)
- [Add an option "IgnoreStdFunctionArguments" to bugprone-argument-comment.](https://github.com/xieyubo/llvm-project/commit/0ef5db32846661cf7fab284582f7342ebacbc82f)

Some changes have been merged back to LLVM master already:

- [Fix bugprone-argument-comment bug if there are marcos.](https://github.com/xieyubo/llvm-project/commit/b882946b522ee3b1f3fb0be5554d04385505226f).
- [Fix bugprone-argument-comment bug: negative literal number is not checked.](https://github.com/xieyubo/llvm-project/commit/b458819012215a9a33f67631f51f19fba1170130).
- [Add bugprone-argument-comment option: IgnoreSingleArgument.](https://github.com/xieyubo/llvm-project/commit/1aa31a81d30f918b27ecd1198c658337f812bc1f).
